# Karate Visual Builder - Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

The Karate Visual Builder is now ready to use! Here's how to get started:

### 1. Development Server
The application is currently running at: **http://localhost:3000**

### 2. Features Available
- ✅ **Visual Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Drag components from the left palette to the canvas
- ✅ **Component Library**: 15+ pre-built components for HTTP requests, authentication, validation, and data management
- ✅ **Real-time Code Generation**: Live preview of generated Karate `.feature` files
- ✅ **Properties Panel**: Configure component properties in the right sidebar
- ✅ **Export Functionality**: Download generated `.feature` files
- ✅ **Demo Flow**: Click "Load Demo Flow" to see a working example

### 3. Component Types Available

#### HTTP Requests
- GET Request
- POST Request  
- PUT Request
- DELETE Request

#### Authentication
- Bearer Token
- Basic Auth
- API Key

#### Validation
- Status Check
- Field Matcher
- Response Time Check

#### Data Management
- Variable Extractor
- Variable Setter

### 4. How to Use

1. **Start Building**: Drag components from the left panel to the canvas
2. **Configure**: Click on any component to configure its properties
3. **Preview**: Watch the generated Karate code update in real-time
4. **Export**: Download the generated `.feature` file

### 5. Example Generated Code

When you create a flow with Bearer Auth → GET Request → Status Check:

```gherkin
Feature: Generated API Test

Scenario: User Test Flow
  * header Authorization = 'Bearer your-token-here'
  Given url 'https://api.example.com/users'
  When method GET
  Then status 200
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Available Scripts
- `npm start` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run eject` - Eject from Create React App

### Project Structure
```
src/
├── components/          # React components
├── lib/                # Core logic (code generation, component definitions)
├── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
├── utils/              # Utility functions
└── data/               # Demo data and examples
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Improvements
1. **Add More Components**: Implement remaining component types (loops, conditionals, etc.)
2. **Flow Connections**: Add visual connection lines between components
3. **Flow Validation**: Add validation for incomplete flows
4. **Save/Load**: Implement flow persistence

### Advanced Features
1. **Custom Components**: Allow users to create custom component types
2. **Flow Templates**: Pre-built flow templates for common scenarios
3. **Integration**: Direct integration with Karate test runner
4. **Collaboration**: Multi-user editing capabilities

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Drag & Drop**: React DnD
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
